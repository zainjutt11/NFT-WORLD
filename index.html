                <p>BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.</p>

                <p>The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. <a href=""> (See Record and Proof.)</a> Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.</p>
                <p>To access members-only areas such as <a href=""> THE BATHROOM </a>, Apeholders will need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.</p>

                <p>Each ape-holder will be able to paint a pixel on the bathroom wall every fifteen minutes. Think of it as a collaborative art experiment for the cryptosphere. A members-only canvas for the discerning minds of crypto twitter.</p>
